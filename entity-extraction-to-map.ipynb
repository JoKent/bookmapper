I knew nothing about stained glass, and I had a most difficult time visiting studios and getting different sketches made by stained glass artists. It was narrowed down in the end to a glass artist called Patterson, who lived in Bideford and who sent me a design for a window that I really admired very much\\\\u0096particularly his colours, which were not the ordinary red and blue but predominantly mauve and pale green, my favourite ones. I wanted the central figure to be the Good Shepherd. I had a little difficulty over this with the Diocese of Exeter, and, I may say, with Mr Patterson; both insisting that the central pattern of an east window had to be the Crucifixion. However, the Diocese, on making some research into the matter, agreed that I could have Jesus as the Good Shepherd, since it was a pastoral parish. I wanted this to be a happy window which children could look at with pleasure. So in the centre is the Good Shepherd with His lamb, and the other panels are the manger and the Virgin with the Child, the angels appearing to the shepherds in the field, the fishermen in their boat with their nets, and the Figure walking on the sea. They are all the simpler scenes of the Gospel story, and I love it and enjoy looking at it on Sundays. Mr Patterson has made a fine window.

This was a delightful spot, right at the foot of the mountains. (I had got over my disappointment about mountains now, but although the position at Cauterets was more satisfactory you could not really look a long way up. Every morning we had a walk along a mountain path which led to the spa, where we all drank glasses of nasty water. Having thus improved our health we purchased a stick of sucre d\\u0092orge. Mother\\u0092s favourite was aniseed, which I could not bear. On the zigzag paths by the hotel I soon discovered a delightful sport.

They had a house at Haslemere, with Spanish chestnut woods all round it.

The war to them was a long drawn-out nightmare that prevented them from going on with their own lives, in the proper way, so their entire talk was of theatrical people, theatrical things, what was going on in the theatrical world, who was going into E.N.S.A.\\u0096it was wonderfully refreshing.&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Haslemere&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 51.0899, &quot;long&quot;: -0.7117, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Haslemere&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-3.557, 50.4], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;11&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;One thing that gave me particular pleasure was writing a story\\u0096a long-short I think they call it: something between a book and a short story\\u0096the proceeds of which went to put a stained glass window in my local church at Churston Ferrers. It is a beautiful little church and the plain glass east window always gaped at me like a gap in teeth. I looked at it every Sunday and used to think how lovely it would look in pale colours. I knew nothing about stained glass, and I had a most difficult time visiting studios and getting different sketches made by stained glass artists. It was narrowed down in the end to a glass artist called Patterson, who lived in Bideford and who sent me a design for a window that I really admired very much\\u0096particularly his colours, which were not the ordinary red and blue but predominantly mauve and pale green, my favourite ones. I wanted the central figure to be the Good Shepherd. I had a little difficulty over this with the Diocese of Exeter, and, I may say, with Mr Patterson; both insisting that the central pattern of an east window had to be the Crucifixion. However, the Diocese, on making some research into the matter, agreed that I could have Jesus as the Good Shepherd, since it was a pastoral parish. I wanted this to be a happy window which children could look at with pleasure. So in the centre is the Good Shepherd with His lamb, and the other panels are the manger and the Virgin with the Child, the angels appearing to the shepherds in the field, the fishermen in their boat with their nets, and the Figure walking on the sea. They are all the simpler scenes of the Gospel story, and I love it and enjoy looking at it on Sundays. Mr Patterson has made a fine window. It will, I think, stand the test of the centuries because it is simple. I am both proud and humble that I have been permitted to offer it with the proceeds of my work.&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Churston Ferrers&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 50.4, &quot;long&quot;: -3.557, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Churston Ferrers&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [11.3, 43.8], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;12&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;Stengel, May\\u0092s maid, met me in Florence, and we went up together in the tram to Fiesole.

It was a mile and a half out of Mosul, and altogether charming\\u0096one that I shall always think of with love and affection. It had a flat roof with a square tower room on one side of it, and a handsome marble porch. Max and I had the upstairs room. It was sparsely furnished, mainly with orange boxes, and had two camp-beds. All round the little house was a mass of rose bushes. They had lots of pink rose-buds on them when we arrived. Tomorrow morning, I thought, the roses will be fully out; how lovely they will look. But no, next morning they were rose-buds still. This phenomenon of nature I could not understand\\u0096a rose is surely not a night-blooming cereus\\u0096but the truth was that these were grown for making ottar of roses and men came at four o\\u0092clock in the morning to pick them as they opened. By daybreak, the next crop of buds was all that remained.&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Nineveh&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 36.366667, &quot;long&quot;: 43.15, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Nineveh&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-0.20932, 51.5025], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;19&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;We found a flat, rather luckily, quite soon. It was on the ground floor of Addison Mansions, which were two big blocks of buildings situated behind Olympia. It was a big flat, four bedrooms and two sitting-rooms. We took it furnished for five guineas a week. The woman who let it to us was a terrifically peroxided blonde of forty-five, with an immense swelling bust. She was very friendly and insisted on telling me a lot about her daughter\\u0092s internal ailments. The flat was filled with particularly hideous furniture, and had some of the most sentimental pictures I have ever seen. I made a mental note that the first thing Archie and I would do would be to take them down and stack them tidily to await the owner\\u0092s return. There was plenty of china and glass and all that kind of thing, including one egg-shell tea-set which frightened me because I thought it so fragile that it was sure to get broken. With Lucy\\u0092s aid, we stored it away in one of the cupboards as soon as we arrived.&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Addison Road&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 51.5025, &quot;long&quot;: -0.20932, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Addison Road&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-157.8572222, 21.30472222], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;20&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;We had a lazy voyage, stopping at Fiji and other islands, and finally arrived at Honolulu. It was far more sophisticated than we had imagined with masses of hotels and roads and motor-cars. We arrived in the early morning, got into our rooms at the hotel, and straight away, seeing out of the window the people surfing on the beach, we rushed down, hired our surf-boards, and plunged into the sea. We were, of course, complete innocents. It was a bad day for surfing\\u0096one of the days when only the experts go in\\u0096but we, who had surfed in South Africa, thought we knew all about it. It is very different in Honolulu. Your board, for instance, is a great slab of wood, almost too heavy to lift. You lie on it, and slowly paddle yourself out towards the reef, which is\\u0096or so it seemed to me\\u0096about a mile away. Then, when you have finally got there, you arrange yourself in position and wait for the proper kind of wave to come and shoot you through the sea to the shore. This is not so easy as it looks. First you have to recognise the proper wave when it comes, and secondly, even more important, you have to know the wrong wave when it comes, because if that catches you and forces you down to the bottom, Heaven help you!&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Honolulu&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 21.30472222, &quot;long&quot;: -157.8572222, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Honolulu&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [51.67472222, 32.6525], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;21&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;We resumed our drive, and arrived, rather weary, in Isfahan, and Isfahan, from that time forward, has been listed by me as the most beautiful city in the world. Never have I seen anything like its glorious colours, of rose, blue and gold\\u0096the flowers, birds, arabesques, lovely fairy-tale buildings, and everywhere beautiful coloured tiles\\u0096yes, a fairyland city. After I saw it that first time I did not visit it again for nearly twenty years, and I was terrified to go there then because I thought it would be completely different. Fortunately it had changed very little. Naturally there were more modern streets, and a few slightly more modern shops, but the noble Islamic buildings, the courts, the tiles and the fountains\\u0096they were all there still. The people were less fanatical by this time, and one could visit many of the interiors of the mosques which were inaccessible before.&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Isfahan&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 32.6525, &quot;long&quot;: 51.67472222, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Isfahan&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-2.21126, 53.3995], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;22&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;We spent Christmas at Abney Hall, with the old Wattses and their four children and Jack. It was a wonderful house to have Christmas in if you were a child. Not only was it enormous Victorian Gothic, with quantities of rooms, passages, unexpected steps, back staircases, front staircases, alcoves, niches\\u0096everything in the world that a child could want\\u0096but it also had three different pianos that you could play, as well as an organ.

It was a lovely picture. Here, while Belcher and Archie were busy putting forth the claims of the British Empire, migration within the Empire, the importance of trade within the Empire, and so on and so forth, I was allowed to spend a happy day sitting in the orange groves. I had a nice long deck-chair, there was delicious sunshine, and as far as I remember I ate twenty-three oranges\\u0096carefully selecting the very best from the trees round me.

From the train journey I brought back carved wooden animals, held up at various stations by little native boys, asking three-pence or sixpence for them. They were delightful.

It is a beautiful little church and the plain glass east window always gaped at me like a gap in teeth. I looked at it every Sunday and used to think how lovely it would look in pale colours. I knew nothing about stained glass, and I had a most difficult time visiting studios and getting different sketches made by stained glass artists. It was narrowed down in the end to a glass artist called Patterson, who lived in Bideford and who sent me a design for a window that I really admired very much\\u0096particularly his colours, which were not the ordinary red and blue but predominantly mauve and pale green, my favourite ones. I wanted the central figure to be the Good Shepherd. I had a little difficulty over this with the Diocese of Exeter, and, I may say, with Mr Patterson; both insisting that the central pattern of an east window had to be the Crucifixion. However, the Diocese, on making some research into the matter, agreed that I could have Jesus as the Good Shepherd, since it was a pastoral parish. I wanted this to be a happy window which children could look at with pleasure. So in the centre is the Good Shepherd with His lamb, and the other panels are the manger and the Virgin with the Child, the angels appearing to the shepherds in the field, the fishermen in their boat with their nets, and the Figure walking on the sea. They are all the simpler scenes of the Gospel story, and I love it and enjoy looking at it on Sundays. Mr Patterson has made a fine window. It will, I think, stand the test of the centuries because it is simple. I am both proud and humble that I have been permitted to offer it with the proceeds of my work.&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Churston Ferrers&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;: 50.4, &quot;long&quot;: -3.557, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Churston Ferrers&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [11.3, 43.8], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;12&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Agatha writes&quot;: &quot;Stengel, May\\u0092s maid, met me in Florence, and we went up together in the tram to Fiesole.
